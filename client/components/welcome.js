          This is a proof of concept app for a dashboard to display real time
          running statistics to a coach. To see all features of the POC, use one
          browser window to log in as an athelete and another incognito window
          to log in as a coach. Key technologies used were React, Redux, Socket.IO, MapBox. ÃŸ
